# Rampage Statue
Inspired by the Rampage Inducer and the concept from [ps9s Rampage Inducer mod](https://forum.plutonium.pw/topic/24383/release-zombies-rampage-inducer?_=1665077522772) (Their download link was broken at the time of making this mod)
I decided to try making one myself.

Simply interact near the statues that are located near the spawn locations.
When the statue is activated zombies will run and be given zero respawn delay for a specified amount of rounds (Customizable but default is Round 20)

## Installation
Download rampagestatue.gsc and put it in your Plutonium T6 scripts folder

```%localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\```

(if the folder isnt there create them)


OR you may use the source code/uncompiled version by using rampagestatue_sourcecode.gsc but if you don't know what youre doing in terms of GSC, I highly recommend you use the first choice

## Configuration
This script is configurable

```set value 0/1```

``rampage_max_round`` - Set the how long the rampage will last - Default: 20
